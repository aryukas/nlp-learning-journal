# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning Journey

Welcome to my **NLP learning repository**!  
This repo documents my hands-on journey through **Natural Language Processing**, covering concepts, implementations, experiments, and notes as I build a strong foundation in working with human language using code.

---

## 📌 Goals of This Repository

- Understand core NLP concepts from basics to advanced topics
- Implement algorithms and models from scratch where possible
- Practice using popular NLP libraries and frameworks
- Build small projects and experiments to reinforce learning
- Maintain clear notes and explanations for future reference

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (and Planned)

### 🔹 Fundamentals
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, stemming, lemmatization)
- Stopword removal
- Bag of Words & TF-IDF
- N-grams

### 🔹 Classical NLP
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Modeling (LDA)

### 🔹 Machine Learning for NLP
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Feature engineering for text data

### 🔹 Deep Learning & Modern NLP
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
- RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
- Transformers & Attention
- BERT and other pretrained language models

If you want, I can:
- Tailor this README to **beginner / intermediate / advanced**
- Add **badges**, **project highlights**, or **learning roadmap**
- Customize it for a **specific NLP focus** (LLMs, research, production, etc.)

Just say the word 👍
